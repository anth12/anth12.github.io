CCNotify is a Chrome browser extension than monitors the projects built using the CruiseControl.net Web Interface for completion of the build.


The plugin comprises of 2 components; a content script & a background script. The content script is a minimal script injected into web pages that when recognised as the CC.net UI will watch for builds triggered by the user and notify background script of any builds (via messaging).
