> Do you know where the repository for project X is?

The project came to being after recieving constant requests along the lines of the above, for legacy reasons we use 3 indipendant Subversion servers at work with no way of knowing which server a repository is located on without searching them all manually. Sure we could maintain a list of repositories manually, but who wants to do that when it can be automated?

Supported Svn servers
- Visual Svn
- Submin
- Uber Svn
